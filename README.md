# Raspberry Pi Pico: MIDI demo.

This is [the MIDI example from Tinyusb][tinymidi], tweaked and configured such that it'll compile on a Raspberry Pi Pico out of the box.

It uses a highly similar CMake configuration to the [Raspberry Pi Examples][examples], so should be compilable in a very similar way: I'm just cribbing from the ["Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico" document][picostart].
